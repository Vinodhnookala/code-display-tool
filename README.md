**UI Design**

1. AI-Generated Modern Web UI

The UI of generated apps is created by Lovable AI based on your prompts or imported designs like Figma.

It typically uses modern web UI components built in React (or other front-end frameworks) — responsive and component-based.

2. Tailwind CSS + Semantic Design Tokens

Lovable outputs designs that use Tailwind CSS utility classes and semantic tokens (primary, secondary, accent, etc.) for consistent styling and theming.

3. Inter and Monospace Fonts

Interfaces often use the Inter font for text and a monospace font for code blocks by default, because that’s what Lovable’s design system tends to emit.

4. Component-Based UI

UI structures are built from reusable components (buttons, cards, modals), with spacing and layout standardized across screens.

5. Visual Editing Support

Once generated, Lovable provides a visual WYSIWYG-style UI editor where you can adjust spacing, colors, fonts, and layout without writing code yourself.
